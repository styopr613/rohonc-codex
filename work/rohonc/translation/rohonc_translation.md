# The Rohonc Codex — a working translation

Translated from `rohonc_reading_full.txt`, which is Király and Tokai's
dictionary laid over their transcription, plus the composed readings gated in
`ktname.py` and `ktsegment.py`. Their page order.

**How to read this.** English first. The gloss it was made from is underneath
in a code span, so every choice can be checked. A word in `[…]` had no reading
at all. A word in `[like this?]` is my guess at an unread word from context. A
`(?)` marks a sense choice I am not confident in. A `|` in the gloss is a gap
or a margin break in the manuscript.

**What this is not.** It is not Király and Tokai's translation, which is
unpublished. Where their published reading of a line exists it is noted and
compared. Every gloss is theirs. The sentence-making is mine and is the part
most likely to be wrong.

**Confidence.** The dictionary reaches 78.8% of the words. Context cannot pick
between senses (measured: `ktsense.py`, `ktgrammar.py`), so I picked them, and
a blind test of that skill earlier in the project scored one to two right out
of six. Treat any single line as a proposal. The story-level reading — what
book this is — rests on many lines agreeing and is much firmer than any one of
them.

## What the book turns out to be

The opening is not a gospel. Folios 004v through 001v tell the **Life of Adam
and Eve**: the fall of Lucifer, the creation of Adam, the breath of life,
Paradise, the rib, Eve, the serpent, the fruit, the shame, and God walking in
the garden asking where Adam is. That is the apocryphal *Vita Adae et Evae*,
not Genesis, because the distinguishing episode is there — God commands the
angels to bow to Adam and Lucifer refuses, which is in the *Vita* and not in
Genesis.

It is framed as a revelation. The angel of God speaks to **Elijah the
prophet**, and Elijah is addressed by name at the start of sections. Chapter
ends are marked in the text with the word Király and Tokai gloss "chapter".

## Recurring unread words, guessed from context

These are guesses, not readings. Listed so they can be checked against every
occurrence, which is the test that would make any of them real.

| code | times | guess | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EAE0` | 217 | **day** | K&T mark it a variant of a code they gloss "day". Sits between "forty" and "forty night" at 004v:11. |
| `E4A2 E4A0 E4A4` | 337 | **and then / thereupon** | Always clause-initial, usually before a name or a speech verb. One glyph from their code for "and". |
| `E540 E60B` | ~76 | an auxiliary, **did / would** | One glyph from their "will, want, future auxiliary". Sits beside eat, take, give all through the Eden pages. |
| `E060 E060 E443 E520` | many | an epithet of God | Follows "God the Father" almost every time it appears. |
| `E520 E3F0 E950 E1F2` | 3 here | **gave / ate** | 001v:5, 8, 9, in the interrogation of Eve. |

> failed attempts trying to guess as a single word.

## 004r — the cup

A formula repeats six times in thirteen lines. I have kept the repetition
rather than smoothing it, because it is the shape of the page.

**1**  The angel of the Father said; God the Father; the angel said to Lucifer: because the cup was hidden away.

## 137v — a prayer to the Virgin, with the author's colophon

This is the page Király and Tokai published a reading of, so it is the one
place the work can be scored against theirs. Their published line is line 3,
and it matches.

**1**  Hail, O Virgin. Through holy Mary, mother of God, […] […]
`healing-girl through holy-Mary mother God [?] [?]`

**2**  Queen Mary, […] Lady […] […] | thou
`king-Mary [?] wife [?] [?] | this`

> Király and Tokai's published reading of line 3 is *sin, without, Jesus,
> conceive, you-Mary*. That is the same line, in their order.
>
> The right-hand margin is a colophon: the author's own name sign repeated
> down the side of the page, once with "I" and twice with the genitive. The
> codex does not inflect, so a name sign standing where a pronoun would stand
